I am Jack Hulspas, a dutch software developer.

This is is my professional GitHub account where I will be hosting multiple projects. 
As opposed to my private/personal account, each project on this account will have the appropriate documentation. Said documentation will include class diagrams, design documents, code documentation and READMEs.

This account won't be used to host smaller or experimental projects, but instead will be used to showcase bigger and more complex projects. Each project on this account will be designed and created with a high standard.
